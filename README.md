Extracting the most updated financial stock data from Yahoo Finance, we can use python to delve into exploratory analysis of stock behaviours on the market. Producing correlation heatmaps, matplotlib, and Scikit Learn's regression model packages predictions can be derived. These basic tools although limited by historical data and its extrapolation, this is only the beginning for endless opportunities in stock price prediction.
